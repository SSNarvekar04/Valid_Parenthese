Valid Parentheses Checker

A simple Python function to check whether a given string of brackets — `()`, `{}`, `[]` — is balanced or not. Useful for interview prep, coding practice, and understanding stack-based algorithms.

##Problem Statement

Given a string containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is valid.

A string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

 Example
 python
Input: s = "{[()]}"
Output: True

Input: s = "{[(])}"
Output: False
